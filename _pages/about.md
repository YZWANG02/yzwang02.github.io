I'm an incoming PhD student (2025 Fall) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), advised by Prof. Xiao HUANG. Previously, I got my bachalor's degree at South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2024.

My research interest
======
Currently, I mainly focus on the following work:
1. Cutting-edge large language model technologies. I'm interested in how to improve the existing LLMs' extended capabilities e.g. reasoning, planning, decision-making, RAG, and further constructing LLM agent and LLM agents system.
2. AI-based interdisciplinary application, especially urban computing and social computing. I focus on how to apply LLMs and other data mining technologies (like graph learning) to solve more real-world problems in the fields of social science, social network, urban govenance, intelligent transportation, etc.
